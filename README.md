maven and gradle are split into separate snippets, located under [partials](https://github.com/ContainerSolutions/minimesos.org/tree/master/themes/minimesos/layouts/partials).

Upon build, Hugo fetches latest version as specified in [index.html](https://github.com/ContainerSolutions/minimesos.org/blob/master/themes/minimesos/layouts/index.html) 
This variable is propagated into templates: 
 * download.html (latest release and documentation links)
 * maven.html (maven version snippet)
 * gradle.html (gradle version snippet)
